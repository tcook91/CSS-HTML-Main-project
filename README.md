# CSS-HTML-Main-project
My primary HTML/CSS website project introduced in my introductory Udemy full stack development course.
With this project, I have been trying to solidify my HTML and CSS basic skills. I have yet to jump into Boostrap or JS at this point in time so functionality is non existent. 
Naturally, the primary focus was for structure and rudimentary style. I will attempt to update this webpage as my learning improved and I can add more functionality and style to the page.
